            <p>
              This agreement is a legally binding contract. It may change as our business changes, and you agree you will review it and any updates regularly. Your continued use of the Service means you accept any changes to these Terms.

            <h2>14. Arbitration, Class Waiver, and Waiver of Jury Trial</h2>
            <p>
              We are located in California, so all disputes must be resolved there. We will use arbitration to resolve any problems, and you cannot join a class action lawsuit or obtain a jury trial for any disputes you have with us related to your use of the Service.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Generally, in the interest of resolving disputes between you and the Company most suitably and cost-effectively, you and the Company agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court and can be subject to minimal review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Site or Products, whether based on contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. You understand and agree that, by entering into these terms, you and the Company each waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.
              </li>
              <li>
                Exceptions. Despite the provisions of the Section entitled “Generally” directly above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
              </li>
              <li>
                Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and the Company will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting the Company. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.
              </li>
              <li>
                Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail or email (“Notice”). The Company’s address for notice is 1346 N Laurel Ave, Unit 105, West Hollywood, CA 90046 or account@teminos.com. The notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make reasonable faith efforts to resolve the claim directly. Still, if the parties do not agree to do so within 30 days after the notice is received, you or the Company may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offered to you or the Company must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, the Company will pay you the highest of the following: (A) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (B) the last written settlement amount offered by the Company in settlement of the dispute before the arbitrator’s award; or (C) $1,000.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fees. If you commence arbitration per these Terms, the Company will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000 or as set forth below, in which case the amount of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will occur at a location to be agreed upon in California. Still, if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards outlined in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of how the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

                No Class Actions. You and the Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and the Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
